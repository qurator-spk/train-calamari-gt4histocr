Train a GT4HistOCR Calamari model
=================================

`train.sh` trains a Calamari model based on GT4HistOCR. Or rather 5 using
cross-validation to use for confidence voting.

Requires Calamari 0.3.5.

`train.sh` is able to download GT4HistOCR from the web if the `data` submodule
is not available, that is if you're not a member of the Qurator team at SBB.
